This repository contains my C Projects, which include a Reversi Game, Battleship Game, Pascal's Triangle, and a Contacts List Project using Linked Lists.

If you like to learn more about my Projects, feel free to email me at nelson.nx.lee@gmail.com.

<h2>
  Project: Contacts List with Linked Lists
</h2>

This Contacts List with Linked Lists Project implements a digital phone book that allows the user to list contacts in alphabetical order, print phone numbers for a contact, find duplicate entries of phone numbers, and delete a contact. The program inputs a user's digital phone book through the file "ContactList.h".

<h2>
  Game: Reversi
</h2>

This Reversi Game implements a board game called Reversi (also referred to as Othello) using 2-D arrays, checks the legality of moves, implements game logic, displays the board state, while the "computer" determines its move based on numerous factors.

- Inside the Reversi file, the user plays against a basic computer program which determines the best move based on the maximum tiles it can flip
- Inside the ReversiPartB file, the user plays against a smarter computer program which determines the best move based on different metrics such as number of tiles it can flip, edge cases, corner cases, and number of opportunities given to the opponent

<h2>
  Game: Battleship
</h2>

This Battleship Game implements 2-D arrays with error checking and functions to allow a user to play Battleship where the main objective of the game is to sink the opponent's ships before they sink your ships. The Battleship Game checks the legality of moves, implements game logic, displays the board state, and randomly generates the computer's move.

<h2>
  Project: Pascal's Triangle
</h2>

The Pascal's Triangle Project uses loops and functions to display a Pascal's Triangle with its size generated by the user.
